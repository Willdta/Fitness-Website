        <p class="animated">My name is Gabriel Pozo and I'm here to help build the best version of yourself. I run the <span><a href="editprogram.html" id="prolink">Weight + Nutrition</a></span> program. Here's a little about me. I've always been very athletic throughout my life. I played tennis competitively since I was 12 and still continue to play to this day. Through tennis, I found the famous P90X. I wanted to improve my fitness level and decided to dedicate myself to the program. After 3 months, I was proud to say that I was in the best shape of my life. After P90X, I stuck to bodyweight exercises as I haven't discovered the effects of weight yet. It was in my first year of college where I started experimenting with weights. In a short week, I fell in love and never looked back. Since then I have been experimenting with tons of different ways to stimulate and grow my body's muscles. My main passion is fitness and it is something that I will never stop loving and I hope to inspire the same effect for fitness on you. I promise to lead you to the best shape of your life through personal care, efficiency and support.</p>

        <p class="animated">My name is Stefano Benedetti and I run the <span><a href="editprogram.html" id="prolink">Athlete + Nutrition</a></span> program. A little about myself, since I was kid, I have competed in various sports at a high level and achieved many trophies but the main sport I have competed in is tennis. I eventually discovered bodybuilding and decided to dedicate a lot of my time to it and in that time I have been training back and forth as an athlete and in bodybuilding to achieve my goals in tennis and in my body. Through my journey I have spent a lot of my time studying the importance of fitness and nutrition, experimenting with all different kinds of programs to help get me the body I wanted. I have been able to identify what methods are best suited to your overall goal whether it is to become a better athlete or improve the look of your body. My mission is to help people achieve their goals in any way I can and build the body that you are looking for. The first step is taking action and being consistent. I have a lot of passion for the fitness industry and am continuously trying to learn more and improve my own physique. I believe that if we work together as a team we can get you to where you want to be.</p>
